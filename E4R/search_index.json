(2021-01-06) This book is for students who majored in Robotics or Mechatronics. It aims at helping students (especially Vietnamese students) to learn both technical English and knowledge in robotics (and mechatronics). The book is regularly updated to state-of-the-art knowledge in robotics and partially mechatronics and AI since these fields are closely connected. There might be some mistakes in this book since I am not an English native speaker. Please let me know so I can correct them.

The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can help and assist humans. Robotics draws on the fields of information engineering, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, artificial intelligence, and others.

"],["reading-what-is-robotics.html", "1.1 Reading: What Is Robotics?", " 1.1 Reading: What Is Robotics? Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments, manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots appear in various forms. Some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today’s robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously started in the past but has only grown rapidly since the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, people reserch, designm and build robots for various purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors, and exploring mines. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid. Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with computer engineering, computer science (especially artificial intelligence), electronics, mechatronics, mechanical, nanotechnology and bioengineering.

Write a paragraph about what robotics can do for a better world. An example is shown below. Industrial robots are mechanical devices which, to a certain degree, replicate human motions. They are used whenever there is a need to reduce the danger to a human, provide more strength or accuracy than a human, or when continuous operation is required. Most robots are stationary, but some move throughout the workplace delivering materials and supplies. — “Industrial Robot.” (encyclopedia.com 2020) Write your paragraph here...

Agriculture, space, travel, medicine, and are just a couple of places robots have begun to appear. You could argue that they have already started to take over our world. Just in the past few decades, robots have reached new heights. The continual and rapid progress of paired with readily available large datasets, lower prices for , and a steady demand for efficiency has created the perfect storm for engineered Yet you should not be intimidated by robots. Though robots are certainly complicated pieces of machinery, they are also delightfully simple to understand. In a lot of cases, robots are based on us humans.
