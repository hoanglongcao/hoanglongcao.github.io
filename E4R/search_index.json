(2021-01-06) This book is for students who majored in Robotics or Mechatronics. It aims at helping students (especially Vietnamese students) to learn both technical English and knowledge in robotics (and mechatronics). The book is regularly updated to state-of-the-art knowledge in robotics and partially mechatronics and AI since these fields are closely connected. There might be some mistakes in this book since I am not an English native speaker. Please let me know so I can correct them.

Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments, manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots appear in various forms. Some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today’s robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously started in the past but has only grown rapidly since the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, people reserch, designm and build robots for various purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors, and exploring mines. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid. Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with computer engineering, computer science (especially artificial intelligence), electronics, mechatronics, mechanical, nanotechnology and bioengineering.

Write a paragraph about what robotics can do for a better world. An example is shown below. Industrial robots are mechanical devices which, to a certain degree, replicate human motions. They are used whenever there is a need to reduce the danger to a human, provide more strength or accuracy than a human, or when continuous operation is required. Most robots are stationary, but some move throughout the workplace delivering materials and supplies. — “Industrial Robot.” (encyclopedia.com 2020) Write your paragraph here...

Robots have jumped from the screen and pages into our reality disrupting almost every modern industry. Agriculture, space, travel, medicine, and are just a couple of places robots have begun to appear. You could argue that they have already started to take over our world.

Several categories of robotic applications are industrial robots, autonomous mobile robots, humanoid robots and educational robots. In the past, robots mainly worked alone in isolated areas. Nowadays, people reserch and develop robots that interact with humans directly. Source: Adapted from the chapter “Robots and their applications” (Ben-Ari and Mondada 2018). "],["reading-classification-of-robots.html", "2.1 Reading: Classification of Robots", " 2.1 Reading: Classification of Robots Robots can be classified according to the environment in which they operate. The most common distinction is between fixed and mobile robots. These two types of robots have very different working environments and therefore require very different capabilities. Fixed robots are mostly industrial robotic manipulators that work in well defined environments adapted for robots. By contrast, mobile robots are expected to move around and perform tasks in large, ill-defined and uncertain environments that are not designed specifically for robots. There are three main environments for mobile robots that require significantly different design principles because they differ in the mechanism of motion: aquatic (underwater exploration), terrestrial (cars) and aerial (drones). Robots for these three environments can be further divided into subclasses: terrestrial robots can have legs or wheels or tracks, and aerial robots can be lighter-than-air balloons or heavier-than-air aircraft. Robots can be classified by intended application field and the tasks they perform. The first robots were industrial robots because the well-defined environment simplified their design. Service robots, on the other hand, assist humans in their tasks. These include home robots like vacuum cleaners, transportation like self-driving cars, and defense applications such as drones. Medicine, too, has seen increasing use of robots in surgery, rehabilitation and training. These are recent applications that require improved sensors and a closer interaction with the user.

A survey of 20,000 employers from 42 countries found that the IT, customer service and advanced industries will add workers over the next two years as a result of automation.
