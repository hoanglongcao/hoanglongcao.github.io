Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments, manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots appear in various forms. Some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today’s robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously started in the past but has only grown rapidly since the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, people research, design, and build robots for various purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors, and exploring mines. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid. Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with computer engineering, computer science especially artificial intelligence (AI), electronics, mechatronics, mechanical, nanotechnology, and bioengineering.

"],["reading-classification-of-robots.html", "2.1 Reading: Classification of Robots", " 2.1 Reading: Classification of Robots Robots can be classified according to the environment in which they operate. The most common distinction is between fixed and mobile robots. These two types of robots have very different working environments and therefore require very different capabilities. Fixed robots are mostly industrial robotic manipulators that work in well-defined environments adapted for robots. By contrast, mobile robots are expected to move around and perform tasks in large, ill-defined, and uncertain environments that are not designed specifically for robots. There are three main environments for mobile robots that require significantly different design principles because they differ in the mechanism of motion: aquatic (underwater exploration), terrestrial (cars), and aerial (drones). Robots for these three environments can be further divided into subclasses: terrestrial robots can have legs or wheels or tracks, and aerial robots can be lighter-than-air balloons or heavier-than-air aircraft. Robots can be classified by the intended application field and the tasks they perform. The first robots were industrial robots because the well-defined environment simplified their design. Service robots, on the other hand, assist humans in their tasks. These include home robots like vacuum cleaners, transportation like self-driving cars, and defense applications such as drones. Medicine, too, has seen the increasing use of robots in surgery, rehabilitation, and training. These are recent applications that require improved sensors and closer interaction with the user.

In the present day, as technological advancements progress, the robots and its methods of control continue to develop and advance. What is autonomy? Autonomy is the ability to make your own decisions. In humans, autonomy allows us to do the most meaningful, not to mention meaningless, tasks. This includes things like walking, talking, waving, opening doors, pushing buttons and changing light bulbs. In robots, autonomy is really no different. Autonomous robots, just like humans, also have the ability to make their own decisions and then perform an action accordingly. A truly autonomous robot is one that can perceive its environment, make decisions based on what it perceives and/or has been programmed to recognize and then actuate a movement or manipulation within that environment. With respect to mobility, for example, these decision-based actions include but are not limited to the following basics: starting, stopping, and maneuvering around obstacles that are in their way.

Light sensor is used to detect light and create a voltage difference. Sound sensor (generally a microphone) detects sound and returns a voltage proportional to the sound level. Temperature sensors are ICs providing voltage difference for a change in temperature. Contact sensors are those which require physical contact against other objects to trigger. Proximity sensor can detect the presence of a nearby object within a given distance, without any physical contact. Tactile pressure sensors are useful in robotics as they are sensitive to touch, force and pressure. Positioning sensors are used to approximate the position of a robot, some for indoor positioning and few others for outdoor positioning. An accelerometer is a device which measures acceleration and tilt. A gyroscope or simply Gyro is a device which measures and helps maintain orientation using the principle of angular momentum. Voltage sensors typically convert lower voltages to higher voltages, or vice versa. Current sensors are electronic circuits which monitor the current flow in a circuit and output either a proportional voltage or a current.

When the sensor is pressed, different colors appear on a screen, depending on the . The sensor also locates the exact spot where pressure is exerted through the computer screen. “The sensor can act as the skin of a robot because it uses rubber to measure electrical resistance.” The team attached electrodes on the surface of sensors and let flow through them.

This composite has the property to change the value of electric on corresponding parts when pressure is exerted from outside. Researchers say manufacturing these sensors is relatively easy and cost efficient. “The sensors can be used widely in the robot industry, and they are particularly promising for rehabilitation purposes.” The research team expects the technology to be applied in a variety of fields such as robotic skin, 3D computer interface, and wearable medical devices.
