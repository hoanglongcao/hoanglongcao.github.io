Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments, manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots appear in various forms. Some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today’s robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously started in the past but has only grown rapidly since the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, people research, design, and build robots for various purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors, and exploring mines. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid. Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with computer engineering, computer science especially artificial intelligence (AI), electronics, mechatronics, mechanical, nanotechnology, and bioengineering.

Several categories of robotic applications are industrial robots, autonomous mobile robots, humanoid robots, and educational robots. In the past, robots mainly worked alone in isolated areas. Nowadays, people research and develop robots that interact with humans directly. Source: Adapted from the chapter “Robots and their applications” (Ben-Ari and Mondada 2018). 2.1 Reading: Classification of Robots Robots can be classified according to the environment in which they operate. The most common distinction is between fixed and mobile robots. These two types of robots have very different working environments and therefore require very different capabilities. Fixed robots are mostly industrial robotic manipulators that work in well-defined environments adapted for robots. By contrast, mobile robots are expected to move around and perform tasks in large, ill-defined, and uncertain environments that are not designed specifically for robots. There are three main environments for mobile robots that require significantly different design principles because they differ in the mechanism of motion: aquatic (underwater exploration), terrestrial (cars), and aerial (drones). Robots for these three environments can be further divided into subclasses: terrestrial robots can have legs or wheels or tracks, and aerial robots can be lighter-than-air balloons or heavier-than-air aircraft. Robots can be classified by the intended application field and the tasks they perform. The first robots were industrial robots because the well-defined environment simplified their design. Service robots, on the other hand, assist humans in their tasks. These include home robots like vacuum cleaners, transportation like self-driving cars, and defense applications such as drones. Medicine, too, has seen the increasing use of robots in surgery, rehabilitation, and training. These are recent applications that require improved sensors and closer interaction with the user.

And German turnover in robotics and automation has grown by % in recent years from billion euros in 2013 to an estimated billion euros in 2019. What’s more, industry experts predict annual growth of % in the years to come. What are some of the current trends? One is that robots and human beings are working together. This can take the form of which allow man and machine to cooperate and which could render elaborate safety precautions such as kill switches obsolete. Another form of man-plus-machine are like the “Cray X” by German Bionic. It helps workers do heavy and repetitive lifting and won its parent company the prestigious German award in 2019. Traditional industrial robots were built to carry out one task or set of tasks ad infinitum. But that too is changing. The next generation of robots will be adaptable to a multitude of jobs.

If we compare robots to human beings, the sensors would be our senses. They send information to the control system (the brain) and we modify our behavior and affect our surroundings through actuators (parts of the body). A robot also needs a source of power in order to function and a physical structure to sustain the elements it is made up of. Source: Adapted from the article “What is a robot? Getting to know sensors and actuators” (DIWO 2015). 4.1 Reading: How is a Robot Controlled? Robotic control is a system that contributes to the movement of robots. This involves the mechanical aspects and program systems that make possible to control robots. Robotics could be controlled in various ways, which includes using manual control, wireless control, semi-autonomous, and fully autonomous. In the present day, as technological advancements progress, robots and their methods of control continue to develop and advance. What is autonomy? Autonomy is the ability to make your own decisions. In humans, autonomy allows us to do the most meaningful, not to mention meaningless, tasks. This includes things like walking, talking, waving, opening doors, pushing buttons, and changing light bulbs. In robots, autonomy is really no different. Autonomous robots, just like humans, also have the ability to make their own decisions and then perform an action accordingly. A truly autonomous robot is one that can perceive its environment, make decisions based on what it perceives and/or has been programmed to recognize and then actuate a movement or manipulation within that environment. With respect to mobility, for example, these decision-based actions include but are not limited to the following basics: starting, stopping, and maneuvering around obstacles that are in their way.

For example: direct wired control, wireless remote control (e.g. wifi, bluetooth, infrared). The easiest way to control a vehicle is with a handheld controller physically connected to the vehicle using a cable (i.e. a tether). Toggle switches, knobs, levers, joysticks and buttons on this controller allow the user to control the vehicle without the need to incorporate complex electronics. In this situation, the motors and a power source can be connected directly with a switch in order to control its forward/backwards rotation. Such vehicles usually have no intelligence and are considered to be more “remote controlled machines” than “robots.” — “Controlling Your Robot.” (Cbenson 2019) Check the Robotshop website for more examples.

Source: Adapted from the Wikipedia article “Robotic Sensors” (Wikipedia contributors 2021d), which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0. 5.1 Reading: Types of Robot Sensors There are hundreds of sensors made today to sense virtually anything you can think of, and it is almost impossible to list all available sensors. A light sensor is used to detect light and create a voltage difference. A sound sensor (generally a microphone) detects sound and returns a voltage proportional to the sound level. Temperature sensors are ICs providing voltage difference for a temperature change. Contact sensors are those which require physical contact against other objects to trigger. A proximity sensor can detect the presence of a nearby object within a given distance, without any physical contact. Tactile pressure sensors are useful in robotics as they are sensitive to touch, force, and pressure. Positioning sensors are used to approximate the position of a robot, some for indoor positioning and a few others for outdoor positioning. An accelerometer is a device that measures acceleration and tilt. A gyroscope or simply Gyro is a device that measures and helps maintain orientation using the principle of angular momentum. Voltage sensors typically convert lower voltages to higher voltages or vice versa. Current sensors are electronic circuits that monitor the current flow in a circuit and output either a proportional voltage or a current.

The latest is this: a sensor that can play the role of a skin for AIs. Kim Mok-yeon sheds light on this discovery. Researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have developed a tactile sensor that can measure not only the amount of pressure applied on contact but also pinpoint the its been touched. When the sensor is pressed, different colors appear on a screen, depending on the . The sensor also locates the exact spot where pressure is exerted through the computer screen. “The sensor can act as the skin of a robot because it uses rubber to measure electrical resistance.” The team attached electrodes on the surface of sensors and let flow through them. The sensors are made with ‘piezoresistive composite’ which is a combination of and carbon nanotube. This composite has the property to change the value of electric on corresponding parts when pressure is exerted from outside. Researchers say manufacturing these sensors is relatively easy and cost-efficient. “The sensors can be used widely in the robot industry, and they are particularly promising for rehabilitation purposes.” The research team expects the technology to be applied in a variety of fields such as robotic skin, 3D computer interface, and wearable medical devices.

By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories. There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air. Source: Adapted from the Wikipedia article “Robotics” (Wikipedia contributors 2021e), which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0. 6.1 Reading: Robot Actuators An actuator is an electromechanical device that converts energy into mechanical work or motion. For robots, actuators are like muscles that perform work. The work can be either to induce motion or to object motion. That is either to start a movement or to stop it. There are different types of actuators available and most of them either create rotational motion or linear motion. Linear actuator creates linear motion. It creates to and fro motion (forward and backward). These actuators can be driven by either linear or rotational motion. To simplify things, let us take an example of a bicycle. When the cyclist pushes the pedal, it rotates the bottom bracket in a cycle which is connected to a roller chain. Now the rotational motion from the bracket creates a linear motion in the roller chain. Rotational actuator induces rotary or rotational motion. A simple DC motor is an example of a rotational actuator. Similar to a linear actuator, rotation actuators can be driven by either linear motion or rotational motion. Let us continue with our bicycle example to understand how linear motion can be used to create rotary motion. The roller chain in a bicycle is connected to the sprocket gear of the driving wheel. When a cyclist pedals, the roller chain (remember that roller chain is an example of linear motion) rotates the sprocket gear creating a rotational motion that further rotates the wheel. Most actuators can be mechanically designed to induce rotary motion or linear motion. A simple nut attached to a linear member can create a rotary motion. On the other hand, attaching a screw to a rotary actuator creates linear motion. The below animations shows both linear motion and rotary motion. The bottom bracket rotates creating a linear motion in the roller chain. Further, the same linear motion of the chain creates rotary motion in sprocket gear. Actuators require energy to create motion and the source of energy is usually electric current, pneumatic pressure, or hydraulic fluid.

Various engineering materials are used in robots to provide shape, strength and durability. Metals, plastics, and composites tend to dominate the structural elements, but other materials are occasionally used. Source: Adapted from the article “Structural Materials for Robots” (Nelson 2020). 7.1 Reading: Robot Materials Here are some of the materials to keep in mind when designing and building robots. Steel is one of the materials used most often by robot builders. This sturdy metal is a smart choice if you’re building a robot that needs to stand up to harsh conditions. It’s possible to harden the steel to between 100,000 and 300,000 pound-force per square inch (psi) in many cases. Demand is growing for commercial robots with flexible exteriors, such as human-like “skin.” Moreover, it’s advantageous for cobots that work alongside humans to have soft surfaces. Rubber and soft plastics can meet that goal. Although aluminum has a higher price point than steel, it’s easier to shape and is lighter. Aluminum is also a good material if you’re worried about a robot’s exterior becoming rusty over time because aluminum does not rust. However, because it can corrode in some wet environments, you might consider treating the surface to give it more protection against possible corrosion. Kevlar is a synthetic fiber frequently used for bulletproof vests. Some of its characteristics make it worth evaluating for robot exteriors, too. You could use it as a covering on robots that require safeguarding from extreme temperatures. Many heat-resistant gloves feature Kevlar because the material does not melt or drip when exposed to hot environments. Investors and developers have become increasingly aware of the need for eco-conscious and sustainable robotics development. Recycled materials and biodegradable plastics would go a long way to helping them achieve that goal. This is just an introductory list to some of the most commonly used materials for robot exteriors. Of course, the material a robot uses will depend primarily on its purpose. For instance, materials used in robot-assisted surgery must be able to withstand rigorous sterilization techniques. In this case, a polymer like acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) would fare far better than a material that can’t stand up to medical requirements and regulations. Some soft robotics materials can even “feel” pain and heal themselves. Source: Adapted from the article “5 materials to evaluate for designing, building robust robots” (robotplatform.com 2021a).

To combat this, researchers have built soft robots with a material that, with a little heat, can reassemble itself after some types of damage. The robots get this factor from their construction. They are made entirely of a synthetic material called an elastomer, short for “elastic .” When heated, the molecular bonds that keep the elastomer together loosen, and begin to reform back to their original cube-like . A little over an hour after being damaged, the material was almost completely healed, and 24 hours after cooling, the only evidence was a small scar. In testing, this material was adapted to a robotic hand, a gripping claw, and an artificial muscle. Each one represents a standard use for a soft robot, and each one was successfully able to heal when heated. The robots could withstand cuts and stabs, and achieved nearly-full once healed. Even after two healing , the robots could still perform well. The researchers say that these elastomers could make soft robots more commonplace, now that their weakness for pointy objects has been eliminated.

Each new area and application may call for specific precautions for operators, maintenance workers, robot systems, and so on. In the past, robot safety did not receive as much attention as it deserved from both manufacturers and users. This scenario is changing in recent years, and robot-related accidents could be one of the factors behind this change. Source: Adapted from the chapter “Fundamentals of Robot Safety” (Dhillon 1991). 8.1 Reading: Workplace Robotics Safety Many hazards and injuries can result from the use of robots in the workplace. Some robots, notably those in a traditional industrial environment, are fast and powerful. This increases the potential for injury as one swing from a robotic arm, for example, could cause serious bodily harm. There are additional risks when a robot malfunctions or is in need of maintenance. A worker who is working on the robot may be injured because a malfunctioning robot is typically unpredictable. There are four types of accidents that can occur with robots. Impact or collision accidents occur generally from malfunctions and unpredicted changes. Crushing and trapping accidents occur when a part of a worker’s body becomes trapped or caught on robotic equipment. Mechanical part accidents can occur when a robot malfunctions and starts to “break down,” where the ejection of parts or exposed wire can cause serious injury. Other accidents at just general accidents that occur from working with robots. There are seven sources of hazards that are associated with human interaction with robots and machines. Human errors could be anything from one line of incorrect code to a loose bolt on a robotic arm. Many hazards can stem from human-based error. Control errors are intrinsic and are usually not controllable nor predictable. Unauthorized access hazards occur when a person who is not familiar with the area enters the domain of a robot. Mechanical failures can happen at any time, and a faulty unit is usually unpredictable. Environmental sources are things such as electromagnetic or radio interference in the environment that can cause a robot to malfunction. Power systems are pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical power sources; these power sources can malfunction and cause fires, leaks, or electrical shocks. Improper installation is fairly self-explanatory; a loose bolt or an exposed wire can lead to inherent hazards. Emerging robotic technologies can reduce hazards to workers, but can also introduce new hazards. For example, robotic exoskeletons can be used in construction to reduce load to the spine, improve posture, and reduce fatigue; however, they can also increase chest pressure, limit mobility when moving out of the way of a falling object, and cause balance problems. For collaborative robots, isolation is not possible. Possible hazard controls include collision avoidance systems, and making the robot less stiff to lessen the impact force.

A robot is a collection of guidelines for robot specifications and in which all involved in the manufacture, sales and use of robots must follow. Often, standards are created by a diverse group of industry interests to ensure the standards benefit everyone. Some common standards include: American National Standards Institute (ANSI) U.S. Standards Body including CSA, BSI, DIN, AFNOR, JISC and more International Organization for Standardization (ISO) International Standards Body International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) International Standards Body Much of the work of robot safety standards organizations is involved in making robot standards.

In a process, it is important to identify the different risk involving the use of a collaborative robot. Evaluating a risk correctly can be a game-changer in your risk assessment process. The risk is usually evaluated using four different criteria: severity of injury, possibility of occurrence, possibility of avoidance, and . Let’s take the simple example of a gripper hitting my hand against the table. The severity of injury is rated from 0.25 to 0.65. The lowest being a scratch or a bruise. The highest being . In this case, the pain level is not even reached when the robot stops. So a rating of 0.25 is accorded to this risk. The second is the possibility of occurrence of the hazard. It is rated from 0.05 being almost impossible to 6 being certain. In this case, we consider that this risk is possible. The third criterion is possibility of avoidance rated from possible being 0.75 to impossible being 5. In this case the robot is not moving fast enough to me instantly. So it is possible to avoid the impact. Finally, the frequency of exposure is rated from 0.5 being annually to 5 being constantly. In this case, the worker is exposed daily to the answer. Then all these criteria are multiplied together to give a certain rate. In this case 1.4 which is considered as being . Once all your risks are evaluated.

Bekey Robots today serve in many roles, from entertainer to educator to executioner. As robotics technology advances, ethical concerns become more pressing: Should robots be programmed to follow a code of ethics, if this is even possible? Are there risks in forming emotional bonds with robots? How might society—and ethics—change with robotics? This volume is the first book to bring together prominent scholars and experts from both science and the humanities to explore these and other questions in this emerging field. Starting with an overview of the issues and relevant ethical theories, the topics flow naturally from the possibility of programming robot ethics to the ethical use of military robots in war to legal and policy questions, including liability and privacy concerns. The contributors then turn to human-robot emotional relationships, examining the ethical implications of robots as sexual partners, caregivers, and servants. Finally, they explore the possibility that robots, whether biological-computational hybrids or pure machines, should be given rights or moral consideration. Ethics is often slow to catch up with technological developments. This authoritative and accessible volume fills a gap in both scholarly literature and policy discussion, offering an impressive collection of expert analyses of the most crucial topics in this increasingly important field.

[From 2:37] How can we create robots that never harm humans? When robots can finally think for themselves, who or what is going to be held responsible, when or if an autonomous system or willfully harms a human. Currently researchers are following a trend that aims at promoting the design and implementation of artificial systems with embedded acceptable behavior. This is all good and well for service robots. They are designed to live peacefully among humans. But what do we do about robots? How do we apply robot ethics to robots that are meant to harm and perhaps even kill humans? Author of The Ethical Landscape of Robotics Noel Sharkey argues that the cognitive capabilities of robots do not match that of humans and thus lethal robots are as they may make mistakes more easily than humans. Indeed Asimov’s laws cannot be theoretically applied to robots that are designed to kill humans. There is also the theory that engineers and designers of robots must assume regarding the ethical consequences of their creations. In other words, engineers and designers of robots must be morally accountable for what they design and bring out into the world. If this is the case then creators of lethal robots take responsibility for the harm those robots do. This is a tricky area to navigate as military robots are a big industry and will continue to become more so. In the end robot ethics seem to leave us with more questions. Only time will tell how the field evolves with the advent of more and more robots. But since the age of robotics is upon us, it might serve us well to explore robot ethics at a .
