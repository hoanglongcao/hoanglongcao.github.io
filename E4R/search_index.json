Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments, manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots appear in various forms. Some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today’s robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously started in the past but has only grown rapidly since the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, people research, design, and build robots for various purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors, and exploring mines. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid. Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with computer engineering, computer science (especially artificial intelligence), electronics, mechatronics, mechanical, nanotechnology, and bioengineering.

"],["reading-classification-of-robots.html", "2.1 Reading: Classification of Robots", " 2.1 Reading: Classification of Robots Robots can be classified according to the environment in which they operate. The most common distinction is between fixed and mobile robots. These two types of robots have very different working environments and therefore require very different capabilities. Fixed robots are mostly industrial robotic manipulators that work in well-defined environments adapted for robots. By contrast, mobile robots are expected to move around and perform tasks in large, ill-defined, and uncertain environments that are not designed specifically for robots. There are three main environments for mobile robots that require significantly different design principles because they differ in the mechanism of motion: aquatic (underwater exploration), terrestrial (cars), and aerial (drones). Robots for these three environments can be further divided into subclasses: terrestrial robots can have legs or wheels or tracks, and aerial robots can be lighter-than-air balloons or heavier-than-air aircraft. Robots can be classified by the intended application field and the tasks they perform. The first robots were industrial robots because the well-defined environment simplified their design. Service robots, on the other hand, assist humans in their tasks. These include home robots like vacuum cleaners, transportation like self-driving cars, and defense applications such as drones. Medicine, too, has seen the increasing use of robots in surgery, rehabilitation, and training. These are recent applications that require improved sensors and closer interaction with the user.

And German turnover in robotics and automation has grown by % in recent years from billion euros in 2013 to an estimated billion euros in 2019. What’s more, industry experts predict annual growth of % in the years to come. What are some of the current trends? One is that robots and human beings are working together. This can take the form of which allow man and machine to cooperate and which could render elaborate safety precautions such as kill switches obsolete. Another form of man-plus-machine are like the “Cray X” by German Bionic. It helps workers do heavy and repetitive lifting and won its parent company the prestigious German award in 2019. Traditional industrial robots were built to carry out one task or set of tasks ad infinitum. But that too is changing. The next generation of robots will be adaptable to a multitude of jobs.
