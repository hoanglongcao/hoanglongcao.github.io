abstract = "Previous studies reported that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show a certain interest in social robots. This makes social robots potential to be a model to teach social skills. This exploratory study aims to investigate whether three types of joint attention skills (i.e. eye-contact, pointing, gaze-following) could be improved for five preschoolers with ASD using an evidence-based robot-modeling intervention with a humanoid social robot NAO. Our observation shows that these children were motivated when interacting with NAO by following and responding correctly to NAO's joint attention behaviors. Although some improvements were found, no pattern or systematic effect could be revealed. In the future, more evidence-based studies are needed to investigate the benefits of robot-assisted therapy more deeply.",

A Field Observational Study on the Placement of Entertaining Robots in Retailing",  abstract  = "Structured abstractPurpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the role of the placement (i.e., location) of humanoid service robots (HSRs) for entertainment applications in retailing by inspecting a multitude of performance metrics along the point-of-sale (POS) conversion funnel. Design/MethodologyThe study was conducted using unobtrusive observations at a Belgian chocolate store. In total, 42 hours of video observation material were collected and analyzed, with an even spread over three conditions: (1) an HSR placed outside, (2) an HSR inside the store, and (3) a control condition (no robot stimuli). All passersby and their interactions with the robot and the store were systematically coded and compared.FindingsThe study found that the better placement of HSRs (inside or outside the store) is contingent on the goals the retailer prioritizes. When the goal is to create awareness and interest towards the store, the HSR should be placed outside, as it has double the stopping power. To induce consumers to enter the store, placement of the HSR inside the store is the better option. Ultimately, however, in terms of the number of transactions and total amount spent, outside placement of the HSR outperforms inside placement.Research limitations/implicationsThis study was not able to verify the internal emotional/cognitive state of the passersby, as the method relied on unobtrusive camera observations. A longitudinal research design would be desirable to exclude potential bias due to the novelty effect.Originality/valueWhile research on robots in retail services is emerging, this study is the first to provide insights on how retailers can decide on the placement of robots inside or outside the store, depending on the particular goals they are aiming to reach at the point of purchase.",  keywords  = "humanoid service robots, observation, field study, POS conversion funnel, retail",  author    = "{De Gauquier}, Laurens and Malaika Brengman and Kim Willems and Hoang-Long Cao and Bram Vanderborght",  year      = "2021",  month     = "5",  day       = "27",  doi       = "10.1108/IJRDM-10-2020-0413",  language  = "English",  volume    = "49",  pages     = "846--874",  journal   = "International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management",  issn      = "0959-0552",  publisher = "Emerald",  number    = "7", }

There is a trend toward using automation technology in response to the COVID-19 crisis not only in developed countries but also in those with lower levels of technology development.

In this work, we investigate the use of automation solutions in Vietnam with locally available materials mainly in the first wave from January to July 2020. We collect COVID-related automation solutions during the first wave of COVID-19 in Vietnam from January to July 2020 through a search process. Our analysis and insights of a panel consisting of various disciplines (i.e. academia, healthcare, government, entrepreneur, media) aim at providing a clear picture of how and to what extent these solutions have been deployed. We found seven groups of solutions from low to high research and development levels (R&D) deployed across the country with various funding sources. Low R&D solutions were widely spread due to simplicity and affordability. High R&D solutions were mainly deployed in big cities. Most of the solutions were deployed during the first phases when international supply chains were limited with a significant contribution of the media. Higher R&D solutions have opportunities to be deployed in the reopening phase. However, challenges can be listed as limited interdisciplinary research teams, market demand, the local supporting industry, end-user validation, and social-ethical issues.

Rigorous clinical studies are conducted to validate the efficacy of RET. Current results indicate that RET can obtain an equivalent performance compared to that of human standard therapy for children with ASDs. We also discuss the next steps of developing RET robotic systems.",  author    = "Hoang-Long Cao and {Gomez Esteban}, Pablo and Madeleine Bartlett and Paul Baxter and Tony Belpaeme and Erik Billing and Haibin Cai and Mark Coeckelbergh and Cristina Costescu and Daniel David and {De Beir}, Albert and {Hernandez Garcia}, Daniel and James Kennedy and Honghai Liu and Silviu Matu and Alexandre Mazel and Amit Kumar and Kathleen Richardson and Emmanuel Senft and Serge Thill and {Van De Perre}, Greet and Bram Vanderborght and David Vernon and Kutoma Wakanuma and Hui Yu and Xiaolong Zhou and Tom Ziemke",  year      = "2019",  month     = "4",  day       = "9",  doi       = "10.1109/MRA.2019.2904121",  language  = "English",  volume    = "26",  pages     = "49--58",  journal   = "IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine",  issn      = "1070-9932",  publisher = "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",  number    = "2", }

Currently, service providers shift from mainly relying on FLEs to including HSRs within the existing workforce. Rather than replacing the human workforce, HSRs have the capability of augmenting the work of FLEs. Yet, relatively little attention has been paid to FLEs' attitudes towards HSRs applied in the context of service interactions. This study aims to explore two key questions: (1) How do FLEs perceive a HSR's ability to perform technical and social tasks required in a customer-oriented service setting? and (2) How do FLEs experience working in an employee-robot team for providing frontline services?This study was conducted in a branded chocolate store located at Brussels Airport. A HSR (Pepper robot) was posted alternately inside and in front of the chocolate store for a couple of days. Passengers could participate in an entertaining quiz via the HSR. After participating, the HSR provided a code to receive a coupon that could be redeemed at the counter. As such, the HSR was used to attract passersby and lure them into the store. Eleven FLEs (two males; age range 20-64) were interviewed regarding their attitudes towards the HSR.The transcripts were content analyzed using NVivo. Considering both technical and social skills, expectations and concerns of the FLEs were addressed. Regarding technical skills, most FLEs expect the HSR to be an extra help for both basic service roles (e.g. providing general store information) and more complex service roles (e.g. giving product recommendations). While six FLEs were concerned about the HSR taking over too many tasks, they believed the HSR is not able to handle some physical tasks (e.g. filling storage racks). Regarding social skills, the FLEs perceive the HSR as an augmentation of the workforce. An employee-robot team is also perceived to work in two stages: the HSR can greet and build some initial rapport with the customer, which can subsequently be taken over by the employee who then becomes the main company representative. Still, the HSR is perceived to provide a dehumanized service experience, as it is currently unable to show genuine emotions. For the same reason, the HSR is (still) not perceived as a real colleague.This study provides both theoretical and managerial insights. Theoretically, a categorization is provided of FLE's attitudes towards HSRs' technical and social service delivery skills. Managerially, the results are valuable to retailers who must leverage the qualities of both FLEs and HSRs for efficient employee-robot customer interactions.",  author    = "{De Gauquier}, Laurens and Malaika Brengman and Kim Willems and Nanouk Verhulst and {De Beir}, Albert and Hoang-Long Cao and Bram Vanderborght",  year      = "2019",  month     = "7",  language  = "English",  pages     = "57--57",  booktitle = "Frontiers in Services", }

Humanoid service robots (HSR) are increasingly being used in retail and consequently changing the foundations of the servicescape. As the store environment is the main laboratory for consumer experiments (Larsen et al., 2017), this study jumps on the bandwagon of a scholarly growing interest in inductive in-store behavior research by means of unobtrusive observations. The present observational study also responds to a recent call by Wirtz et al. (2018) to examine customer-service robot interactions on a micro level-perspective. Additionally, it adds to the research of Aaltonen et al. (2017), by also observing initial responses to a HSR in a shopping environment, but more in depth, without intervening in the customer-robot interaction and over a more extended time period. This paper is probably the first in-depth observational field study analyzing human-robot interactions in terms of real in-store and spending behavior. Furthermore, observed customer interactions with the HSR are systematically compared with customer interactions with a tablet service kiosk (TSK), to inspect what added value investing in HSR can offer to retailers. The research has been conducted in a branded chocolate store located at Brussels Airport. The analysis of the 42 hours of video-taped observational footage has been systematically performed along the hierarchy of the AIDA model (attention, interest, desire and action). The experimental design of this field study consists of three conditions, namely a control, TSK and HSR condition. In total, six days (two days of seven hours per condition) were recorded, resulting in a total of 42 hours of camera footage. A quiz related to chocolate in general as well as to the specific products and brands inside the store was provided to the passengers via the two alternative media channels (TSK and HSR). Passersby were tracked when walking along the store and when starting an interaction with either the TSK or HSR. A total of 106,357 passengers (Ncontrol = 33,900, NTSK = 36,394, NHSR = 36,063) and 963 interactions were registered (NTSK = 34, NHSR = 929). We expected the HSR to outperform the TSK at all four stages of the AIDA model and found this largely confirmed in our observations. With respect to the first stage of the AIDA model 'Attention', our research findings demonstrate that a HSR was able to attract more passengers to start an interaction, which also generated larger groups of bystanders (see video in De Gauquier et al., 2018). Regarding the second stage 'Interest', we found that while the HSR was able to trigger longer interactions, less people were actually looking at the store while interacting with the HSR as compared to the TSK. On the other hand, a longer interaction time with the HSR appeared to lead to higher odds of entering the store in comparison with the TSK, which indicates that their 'Desire' was triggered more via the HSR. Moreover, the HSR appeared to convince more people to enter the store in comparison with the TSK. Considering the last stage 'Action', however, relatively more people were recorded to have bought something after interacting with the TSK as compared to the HSR. Nonetheless, overall, a larger number of unique transactions was registered, and the average amount spent per customer appeared to be higher during the period when the HSR was present in comparison to the control and TSK conditions.To conclude, this study provides retail practitioners with valuable insights to understand the merits of implementing a HSR. More specifically, the research findings prove that deploying a HSR as an in-store promotional instrument is more effective than a traditional TSK in terms of the AIDA model.",  author    = "{De Gauquier}, Laurens and Malaika Brengman and Kim Willems and {De Beir}, Albert and Hoang-Long Cao and Bram Vanderborght",  year      = "2019",  month     = "7",  language  = "English",  booktitle = "Recent Advances in Retailing and Services Science (forthcoming)", }

Furthermore, we discuss how the design of the actuator can be optimized for energy efficiency. This strategy is applied to a case study, where a 250 W geared DC motor is replaced by a more efficient dual-motor actuator.

They are proposed not only as part of entertainment and education, but also of care, social assistance and therapy. As such, several institutions from industry are buying social assistive robots and start to use them in classrooms or during therapy sessions without having empirical support and thus, no evidence-based protocols to follow. For example, there has been an increasing interest in Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT) for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD (ASD). While there is much declared as being hopeful and exciting about using robots for treating children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a great variability in responding towards a robot is observed in children with ASD (Feil-Seifer & Mataric, 2011). Also, researchers declare that it will take much research effort before robots become mainstream in intervention. Moreover, experts are advocating caution and express the need to explore the development path of the child-robot relation. Nevertheless, there is a need to focus on which are the roles and how the robots should embrace them in a therapy setting for children with ASD.

It was examined if the children differed in the way how they follow the gaze, alternate eye-contact, share social information with the two partners. Participants achieved significantly higher JA performance with the human partner compared to the robot. Our outcomes are in contradiction with existing research and suggest to be more cautious in promoting or using robotic tools when training JA for children with ASD. When, how, for which purpose robots can be used in the treatment of children with ASD remains still unclear. Despite of the so declared potential of robots, rigorous studies are needed to provide answers to these questions.",  author    = "{Simut Vanderborght}, Ramona and Johan Vanderfaeillie and Hoang-Long Cao and Dirk Lefeber and Bram Vanderborght",  year      = "2016",  month     = "9",  day       = "16",  language  = "English",  booktitle = "XI Autism Europe International Conference", }

The more autonomous the robot, the less control therapists have over the robot-child interaction, raising the issue of where the responsibility for the robot's actions lies. Autonomy also raises the problem of trust: are parents happy to have their child interact with a robot? Will the child trust the robot? The Eurobarometer study of public attitudes towards robots, shows thatmany people in Europe resist this idea of using robots in care. The aim of this paper is to investigate the ethical issues raised by the use of robots in therapy for children with ASD by means of a survey amongst caregivers, parents and teachers of children with ASD.
