<h1 id="work-environment">Work environment</h1>

<p>BruBotics is the Brussels Human Robotics Research Center of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. 8 research groups strive together to improve the quality of life and working conditions of people through Human Robotics. BruBotics uniquely combines expertise on robotics, AI, rehabilitation sciences, movement sciences, social sciences, retail marketing, ageing and eHealth and is as such one of the only truly interdisciplinary robotics research centers in Europe. Together with industrial and societal partners we strive to take the next step in Human Robotics by breaking boundaries.</p>

<p>The Robotics research group (VUB-imec) studies different aspects of human-robot collaboration such as safety, ergonomics, reinforcement learning and task allocation. The group has built a large international collaboration network with a wide variety of academic institutions, industrial partners and R&amp;D centers, and participates in numerous fundamental, strategic and applied research projects in these domains.</p>

<h1 id="research-area">Research area</h1>

<p>The research focuses on the introduction of new State of Art sensors in physical human-machine systems, mainly for smart industries. For machines such as cobots and exoskeletons, an analysis of the surrounding environment including humans is essential to provide a safe human-machine interaction. Research topics include the integration of various types of sensors, multi-sensory analysis, human-machine interfaces, etc. The work will be validated in various smart industries applications with our partners.</p>

<p>Besides scientific challenges, this research position provides a great opportunity to work closely together with experienced researchers active in collaborative robot, signal processing and artificial intelligence as well as to closely collaborate in running projects with prestigious academic and industrial partners active in these fields. A particularly important opportunity will be to closely collaborate with imec research groups active in these areas.</p>

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>

<p>Candidates for a PhD position (4 years) must prove a strong academic record in engineering, mathematics and computer sciences. The ideal candidate has a strong background in electronics and embedded systems. Other relevant backgrounds include robotics, mechatronics,  electromechanical engineering and digital signal processing. The candidate should have experience in electronic/mechatronic/robotic system design and integration, good programming skills (Python, C/C++ and MATLAB) and experience in ROS (Robot Operating System).  Internships in industry or research centers is a plus. You have excellent oral and written communication skills. Fluency in English is a must, given the international character of the involved research groups.Interested?</p>

<p>Interested candidates should submit their application, including a motivation letter, a CV, the BSc and MSc transcripts of grades, the MSc thesis, a list of relevant projects and publications, a two page research proposal (optional), and the names of two people who could provide references.</p>

<h1 id="interested">Interested?</h1>

<p>The application should be jointly sent to:</p>

<p>Prof. Dr. Ir. Bram Vanderborght</p>
