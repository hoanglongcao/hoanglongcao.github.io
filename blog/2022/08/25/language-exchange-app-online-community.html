            <p class="date">August 25, 2022</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This work reflects critically my experience of using a language exchange app. Yes, I did find a few language exchange partners. But more than that, I found an entire online community where people share different things in life and at some points forgot that they installed this app to practice languages. The stories that they shared, in my belief, are authentic.</p>

<h4 id="my-pathway">My pathway</h4>

<p>As a Vietnamese living abroad in a country where English is not one of the official languages, I have been struggling with learning the local languages to better integrate myself with the local society. Of course, I cannot stop random people on the street and ask them to practice the ABCs. By chance, I found a language learning app where users can exchange their languages together.</p>

<p>Any user of this language exchange app (<em>the app</em>) can open a virtual room and specify the languages that they aim to practice. There I found my need to talk to random people in my own language. Well, I miss this feeling undeniably.</p>

<p>I listened to stories from other young people and also shared my own stories. Sometimes they discussed random topics. Other times they just want to be there seeing each other profile pictures without talking, even overnight. I experienced many times that a member asked another one not to go to sleep or just not to close the app.</p>

<p>And from my side, I started to spend most of my time ‘sitting’ in the Vietnamese virtual rooms instead of practicing other foreign languages.</p>

<p>Why is that? - I was curious about my motivations. As a researcher, I allow myself to examine my own experience by using the <em>personal narrative</em> to express my though I don’t claim it to be very critical <a class="citation" href="#holman2007autoethnography">[1]</a>.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-my-motivations">What are my motivations?</h4>

<p>As a quantitative researcher, I found it extremely difficult to structurize my experience when being a member of the online community. So, I borrowed the five components of social network site use motivations developed by <em>Kim, Sohn, and Choi in 2011</em>, which were based on previous findings <a class="citation" href="#kim2011cultural">[2]</a>.</p>

<h6 id="seeking-friends">Seeking Friends</h6>

<p>I did not have the need to meet new Vietnamese people whether or not they shared similarities with me in all aspects. Of course, I value such online friends if I meet them by chance. Talking with people with the same interests is always interesting in any medium but actively seeking them, I do not think I had such motivation.</p>

<h6 id="seeking-convenience">Seeking Convenience</h6>

<p>I do miss the feeling of speaking Vietnamese with the Vietnamese people but didn’t actively seek it. However, this app satisfied my need with little effort because I could use it anytime and anywhere whether it is during a 10-minute coffee break or when I am queuing to buy a sandwich.</p>

<h6 id="seeking-social-support">Seeking Social Support</h6>

<p>These components contain interesting items such as letting out my emotions easily to others, talking out my problems and getting advice, and letting others know I care about their feelings. I cannot recall that I had such behaviors but I witnessed other people doing that.</p>

<h6 id="seeking-information">Seeking Information</h6>

<p>I really learned a lot about unknown things when using this app. Besides chit-chat moments, sometimes we discussed different topics and I gained quite some knowledge. People also shared their personal stories and I believe that most of them if not all were authentic. And yes, I got new ideas and ‘conducted’ this work, based on a recommendation from a member.</p>

<h6 id="seeking-entertainment">Seeking Entertainment</h6>

<p>I cannot ignore that using listening to and talking to Vietnamese people in this app was entertaining. It made me partially forget about work and other things. Sometimes I felt relaxed - but not very excited. With my busy schedule, I did not think this app could help me pass the time but it did during the time I was on bed fighting COVID.</p>

<h4 id="x">…[X]…</h4>

<p>This not-so-critical work examined my personal experience when using a language exchange app in which I ended up mainly speaking with my countryman. I obviously shared most of the items of the five components of social network site use motivations.</p>

<p>I questioned whether or not people from other countries also have similar communities in this app. Although my language skills are not sufficient to answer this question, I really had a feeling that the connections among people of the Vietnamese community in this app are stronger than those from other countries.</p>

<p>Is it because of cultural, social, or political issues? Well, I am not qualified to answer. My ‘autoethnographic’ journey ends here.</p>

<h4 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h4>

<p>Although this work only reflects my personal experience using a language exchange app and no data or stories from any members of the online community were revealed, I deeply thank them for accepting me as a member and sharing interesting stories. I also apologize if I brought them any uneasy experience.</p>
