  abstract  = "Many robots for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)studies have recently been developed with an ability to exhibit social behaviors. These social robots are applied in various domains such as education, entertainment, medicine, and collaboration. Besides the undisputed advantages, a major difficulty in HRI studies with social robot is that the robot platforms are typically expensive and/or not open-source. It burdens researchers to broaden experiments to a larger scale or apply study results to daily life. This paper describes a method to modify My Keepon, a toy version of Keepon robot, to be a programmable platform for HRI studies, especially for robot-assisted therapy. With an Arduino microcontroller board and an open-source Microsoft Visual C# software, users are able to fully control sounds and motions of My Keepon, and configure the robot to the needs of research. Peripherals can be added for advanced studies (e.g., mouse, keyboard, buttons, PlayStation2 console, Emotiv neuroheadset, Kinect). Our psychological experiment results show that My Keepon modification is a useful and low-cost platform in several HRI studies.",

  abstract  = "Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can often experience an information overload when they interact with people. Therefore, they can find social interaction threatening, making them withdraw, even from family members. It has been declared that robots are able to engage children with ASD in social tasks. These outcomes are hypothesized to be the result of several strengths the robots have, in comparison with human interaction partners. They express human-like behaviors, but these behaviors can be break down in small pieces and presented only partially, repeatable and less intense to the children with ASD. This makes communication, with all its complex and frightening subtleties and nuances, less complicated and more comfortable for them. Aim was to investigate if a social robot is able to trigger joint attention (JA) in young children with ASD. 25 children were exposed to a JA task with respectively, a therapist and a robot. It was examined if the children differed in the way how they follow the gaze, alternate eye-contact, share social information with the two partners. Participants achieved significantly higher JA performance with the human partner compared to the robot. Our outcomes are in contradiction with existing research and suggest to be more cautious in promoting or using robotic tools when training JA for children with ASD. When, how, for which purpose robots can be used in the treatment of children with ASD remains still unclear. Despite of the so declared potential of robots, rigorous studies are needed to provide answers to these questions.",

In this paper, we discuss the novel end-effector mode of the method, which can be used to calculate gestures whereby the position of the end-effector is important, for example for reaching for or pointing towards an object. The interesting and innovative feature of our method is its high degree of flexibility in both the possible configurations wherefore the method can be used, as in the gestures to be calculated. The method was validated on several configurations, including those of the robots ASIMO, NAO and Justin.

  abstract  = "In the last three decades, robots are placed in the picture by media and are becoming more accessible in daily use. They are proposed not only as part of entertainment and education, but also of care, social assistance and therapy. As such, several institutions from industry are buying social assistive robots and start to use them in classrooms or during therapy sessions without having empirical support and thus, no evidence-based protocols to follow. For example, there has been an increasing interest in Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT) for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD (ASD). While there is much declared as being hopeful and exciting about using robots for treating children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a great variability in responding towards a robot is observed in children with ASD (Feil-Seifer & Matarić, 2011). Also, researchers declare that it will take much research effort before robots become mainstream in intervention. Moreover, experts are advocating caution and express the need to explore the development path of the child-robot relation. Nevertheless, there is a need to focus on which are the roles and how the robots should embrace them in a therapy setting for children with ASD. Therefore, more longitudinal studies are necessary in order to better approach these questions and provide accurate answers. This study will focus on using a social robot with the role of a model, a cool smart peer that will demonstrate joint attention skills for three children with ASD during a long-term intervention program. Each participant was exposed to three phases: baseline measurements, Robot Modeling Intervention (RMI), and baseline measurements. In each phase JA behaviors were assessed three times per week in a naturalistic environment, such as their classroom during the free-play moment. The RMI intervention proved to be effective for some of the targeted behaviors, such as eye contact and pointing, for two of the three participants. However, the results were highly fluctuating across the participants and thus they remain inconclusive. However, this study offers a valuable insight in the field of both ASD intervention and human robot interaction research fields.",

The more autonomous the robot, the less control therapists have over the robot-child interaction, raising the issue of where the responsibility for the robot’s actions lies. Autonomy also raises the problem of trust: are parents happy to have their child interact with a robot? Will the child trust the robot? The Eurobarometer study of public attitudes towards robots, shows thatmany people in Europe resist this idea of using robots in care. The aim of this paper is to investigate the ethical issues raised by the use of robots in therapy for children with ASD by means of a survey amongst caregivers, parents and teachers of children with ASD. We conclude that although in general stakeholders approve of using robots in therapy for children with ASD, it is wise to avoid replacing therapists by robots and to develop and use robots that have at what we call supervised autonomous interaction.",

  title     = "A collaborative homeostatic-based behavior controller for social robots in Human-Robot Interaction experiments",
  abstract  = "Robots have been gradually leaving laboratory and factory environments and moving into human populated environments. Various social robots have been developed with the ability to exhibit social behaviors and collaborate with non-expert users in different situations. In order to increase the degree of collaboration between humans and the robots in human-robot joint action systems, these robots need to achieve higher levels of interaction with humans. However, many social robots are operated under teleoperation modes or pre-programmed scenarios. Based on homeostatic drive theory, this paper presents the development of a novel collaborative behavior controller for social robots to jointly perform tasks with users in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) experiments. Manual work during the experiments is reduced, and the experimenters can focus more on the interaction. We propose a hybrid concept for the behavior decision-making process, which combines the hierarchical approach and Parallel-rooted, Ordered, Slip-stack Hierarchical (POSH) architecture. Emotions are associated with behaviors by using the two-dimensional space model of valence and arousal. We validate the usage of the behavior controller by a joint attention HRI scenario in which the NAO robot and a therapist jointly interact with children.",

  title     = "Modeling and design of an energy-efficient dual-motor actuation unit with a planetary differential and holding brakes",
  abstract  = "By connecting two drivetrains to a single load, a redundant degree of freedom is created. In this work, we investigate how the redundancy of such a system can be exploited in order to make it more energy efficient. The system under study consists of two drivetrains coupled to a planetary differential. Both drivetrains are composed of a geared DC motor and a holding brake. First, we derive an accurate semi-empirical model of this system and prove its validity on a test setup. Based on this model, which includes nonlinear friction terms, we analyze how the power flows and energy losses depend on the redundant degree of freedom. Furthermore, we discuss how the design of the actuator can be optimized for energy efficiency. This strategy is applied to a case study, where a 250 W geared DC motor is replaced by a more efficient dual-motor actuator. Experiments confirm that a dual-motor actuator succeeds in reducing the energy consumption at various loads and speeds. We also show that the results are very sensitive to friction and other speed- and load-dependent losses.",
